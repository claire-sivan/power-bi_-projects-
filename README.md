Power BI projects - Designing and developing interactive reports and dashboards to visualize data and derive insights 
Analysis done on Power BI based on budget vs actual.

The data consists of 12 months' worth of budget and forecast data and six months of actual data for the IT department of a global company.
The forecast, budget, and actuals contain records of the date,IT department, cost element, and country these are fact tables.
Dimension tables that contain a further grouping of the cost element, IT department, and country.

Analysis: I have done the analysis and created the dashboard on Power BI. 
The Overview helps users analyze the performance of the company over the last 12 months understand which geographies and functional areas are underperforming and take the next course of action.
Budget vs Forecast charts in this view give a very good understanding of underperforming areas of the company. 
The Region view will help management to understand which regions are performing well, they can investigate more to know what went well in these regions and implement the same strategies in underperforming regions
In the Decomposition view, we dig deeper to understand how different categories contribute to either positive or negative Budget vs Forecast numbers
